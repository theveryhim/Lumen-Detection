# Lumen Detection

Lumen detection in colonoscopy images refers to the identification and location of the central region of the intestinal tract (lumens) in colonoscopy images. This is done to correct guidance, improve the quality of imaging, and
It is very important to avoid navigational errors. Also, accurate detection of lumens can be effective in increasing the accuracy of lesion detection and improving the segmentation of polyps.

In this repo, we represent our work on colonoscopy images by light weight models 
as binary classifiers

## SqueezeNet
We trained **SqueezeNet v1.1** from scratch with a custom lightweight classification head:

- Final classifier:  
  `Conv2D(512 â†’ 32) â†’ BatchNorm â†’ ReLU â†’ AdaptiveAvgPool2d â†’ Linear(32 â†’ 1)`
- Output is passed to `BCEWithLogitsLoss` for binary classification.
- Trainable params: `739,009`

## MobileNetV3small

We Fine-tuned MobileNetV3 Small, a lightweight convolutional neural network, pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned for our binary classification task. Final layer adapted to output a single logit â†’ Binary classification with BCEWithLogitsLoss

*   **Model:** MobileNet V3 small
*   **Weights:** Pretrained
*   **Trainable params:** `1,518,881`
*   **Loss Function:** BCEWithLogitsLoss for binary output
*   **Optimizer:**
    -  Adam optimizer with learning rate 1e-4
    -  Learning rate scheduling using ReduceLROnPlateau
    -  Early stopping based on validation loss
